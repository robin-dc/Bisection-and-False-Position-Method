# Bisection and False-Position : Overview
Used to finds the root of a polynomial equation using 2 guesses.

<br>

## ⚒ How does it work?

1. The program will instruct the user to choose the type of method and the constants for a, b and c to produce a quadratic equation.

<br>

2. If the equation you created was possible, it will proceed to ask your guesses.

<br>

3. If the root is in between your guesses, the program will then show the process of guessing and will terminate with a stopping criterion of 0.5%.
